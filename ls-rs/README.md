# ls-rs

A modern implementation of the `ls` command in Rust, featuring rich output formatting, flexible sorting options, and SELinux support.

## Features

- **Display Formats**
  - Long format (`-l`)
  - Columnar output (default)
  - Human-readable sizes (`-h`)
  - Colorized output (`-c`)

- **Sorting Options**
  - By name (`-s name`, default)
  - By size (`-s size`)
  - By modification time (`-s time`)
  - By extension (`-s extension`)
  - By file type (`-s type`)
  - By owner (`-s owner`)
  - By group (`-s group`)
  - Directories first (`-d`)
  - Case-sensitive sorting (`--case-sensitive`)
  - Reverse order (`-r`)

- **Filtering**
  - Show hidden files (`-a`)

- **Security Features**
  - Unix permissions display
  - SELinux context support (`-Z`)

## Architecture

The project is organized into several modules:

- `core/`
  - `display.rs`: Handles output formatting and terminal display
  - `filesystem.rs`: File system operations and metadata collection
  - `sorting.rs`: Flexible file sorting implementation

- `security/`
  - `permissions.rs`: Unix permission handling
  - `selinux.rs`: SELinux context support

- `options/`
  - `filtering.rs`: File filtering options
  - `formatting.rs`: Output formatting options

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -- --path /path/to/directory
```

## Implementation Details

- Uses the Rust standard library for file system operations
- Leverages `clap` for command-line argument parsing
- Implements Unix-specific features using platform-specific traits
- Provides SELinux support through the `selinux` crate
- Supports colorized output with ANSI escape codes
- Handles terminal width detection for optimal display

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```
